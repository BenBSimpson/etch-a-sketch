This project is part of the Web Development coursework at The Odin Project. 

The intent is to create an "Etch-a-Sketch" style drawing program. The requirements listed were as follows:

-Create a gitHub repository for the project.
-Use javascript to create a grid of squares.
	-The grid begins at 16 x 16 squares.
	-Add jQuery to the file if necessary.
	-Set up an effect that causes the squares to change color as the mouse cursor passes over them.
-Create a reset button at the top of the page that clears the current drawing and allows the user to change the size of the squares withouth affecting the 	total size of the drawing area.
